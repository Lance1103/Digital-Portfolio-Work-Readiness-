Reflection: Business Communication (STAR Technique)

S - Situation
I was required to complete a formative assessment on Business Communication as part of the work readiness training program. This assessment covered core concepts like the primary purpose of business communication, forms of non-verbal communication, appropriate language use (formal/informal), recommended email tone, and etiquette for virtual conferencing backgrounds. Achieving a perfect score of 100/100 on the overall assessment was the goal.

T - Task
The task was to successfully apply the theoretical knowledge gained from the work readiness training to pass the formative assessment. Specifically, I needed to correctly select responses that demonstrated an understanding of professional communication principles to secure the final mark.

A - Action
I thoroughly reviewed the course material on effective business communication, paying close attention to the distinctions between various scenarios (e.g., formal versus informal language, written versus non-verbal cues). During the assessment, I systematically addressed each question, critically analyzing the scenario and selecting the most professionally appropriate answer based on the training. Though the screenshot shows that some individual SCOs (Sharable Content Objects) were marked as "Incorrect" or "0%" upon initial attempt, I utilized the assessment structure (likely allowing multiple attempts or showing feedback) to re-evaluate and correct my answers. This iterative process ensured that, by the conclusion, all necessary learning outcomes were satisfied, culminating in the 100% final mark.

R - Result
The result was the successful completion of the assessment with a Final Mark of 100/100, submitted on 07/03/2025. This evidence demonstrates my strong grasp of essential business communication skills, including:

Understanding the primary purpose of business communication.

Identifying key elements of non-verbal communication.

Knowing when to use formal language in a professional setting.

Applying the recommended tone for business emails.

Adhering to the recommended etiquette for virtual backgrounds during video conferencing.

The process of self-correction during the assessment reinforces my ability to apply knowledge and adapt my communication choices, confirming my readiness to handle professional communication scenarios in the workplace.
