Reflection: Professional Networking (STAR Technique)

S - Situation
I was required to complete a formative assessment on Professional Networking as a core component of the work readiness training program. This assessment focused on key networking concepts, including the primary purpose of professional networking, understanding networking event terminology (like 'networking event'), applying the 'golden rule' of networking, identifying common mistakes to avoid, and outlining the first steps in creating a professional network. A final mark of 100/100 was achieved on this submitted formative assessment.

T - Task
The task was to demonstrate a comprehensive, theoretical understanding of effective professional networking strategies. I needed to correctly identify and apply the principles required to build and maintain beneficial professional relationships, which is a critical skill for career growth and job seeking.

A - Action
I dedicated time to studying the networking module, focusing particularly on the strategic steps for initiating a network and the ethical guidelines, such as the 'golden rule'. I paid close attention to differentiating between effective networking behaviours and common mistakes, ensuring I grasped the nuances of professional interaction. During the assessment, I used my foundational knowledge to address each question systematically. Although some individual items required careful reconsideration (as indicated by the multiple attempts and score breakdown shown in the evidence), the final result of 100% confirms that I successfully assimilated and applied the core principles.

R - Result
The result is the successful completion of the formative assessment with a Final Mark of 100/100. This artefact serves as clear evidence of my proficiency in fundamental professional networking concepts. I have learned and demonstrated the capacity to:

1) Articulate the primary purpose of professional networking.

2) Understand the etiquette encapsulated in the 'golden rule' of networking.

3) Recognize and avoid common networking mistakes.

4) Strategically identify the first steps in creating a professional network.

This knowledge ensures I can approach networking opportunities professionally and effectively to enhance my future career prospects.
