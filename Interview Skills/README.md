Reflection: Interview Skills (STAR Technique)

S - Situation
I was required to complete a formative assessment on Interview Skills as part of the work readiness training program. This assessment covered crucial aspects of the job interview process, including the primary purpose of an interview, common structured response methods like CAR, company research, and strategies for answering behavioral questions like "Tell me about yourself" and "What is your greatest weakness". Achieving a final mark of 100/100 was the objective.

T - Task
The task was to demonstrate comprehensive knowledge of effective interviewing strategies by correctly answering all questions in the assessment. I needed to showcase my preparedness to participate confidently and professionally in a real-world interview scenario, ensuring I understood best practices for preparation, execution, and follow-up.

A - Action
I thoroughly studied the training modules focusing on interview preparation. Specifically, I reviewed the structure and purpose of the CAR (Context, Action, Result) method for competency-based questions, practiced framing answers to showcase strengths while discussing weaknesses constructively, and understood the importance of researching the company beforehand. Through a systematic approach to the assessment, I ensured every question was answered accurately, leading to the 100% result.

R - Result
The result was the successful submission and completion of the Interview Skills formative assessment with a Final Mark of 100/100. This achievement confirms my readiness to apply strategic interviewing techniques. I now possess the theoretical knowledge to:

Articulate the purpose of a job interview.

Structure compelling responses using methods like CAR.

Understand how to best introduce myself and handle challenging behavioral questions.

Prioritize company research as a key preparatory step.

This evidence and reflection demonstrate not just knowledge retention, but also the capacity to strategically prepare for and navigate professional job interviews.
