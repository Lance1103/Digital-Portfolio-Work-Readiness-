Reflection: Mock Interview (STAR Technique)

S - Situation
Following the theoretical training on interview preparation and techniques, I was required to undertake a Mock Interview. The specific deliverable was to record a video of myself answering a selection of common interview questions, simulating a real job interview environment and scenario.

T - Task
My primary task was to effectively apply all learned interview skills including professional communication, appropriate body language, and the STAR  method in a practical, recorded setting. I needed to demonstrate confidence, clarity in my responses, and professionalism in my appearance and a neutral background to create a strong, positive impression, as if I were truly interviewing for a role.

A - Action
I first selected six core interview questions (e.g., Tell me about yourself, How do you handle stress?, Highest Level of education completed, Example of prioritizing tasks, What does the future of the industry look like to you? and How would you describe yourself in one word?). Before recording, I rehearsed using the STAR technique to structure my answers, ensuring each response was concise yet detailed, highlighting relevant achievements and skills. I made sure i had a neutral background, ensured good lighting, and maintained direct eye contact with the camera. The resulting video served as a self-critique tool, allowing me to observe and adjust my non-verbal cues and my speaking pace for better delivery.

R - Result
The recorded Mock Interview video is the resulting artefact, which provides tangible evidence of my practical readiness. By reviewing the video, I identified strengths in my structured storytelling and professional appearance, and areas for improvement, such as reducing filler words and further refining my pitch. This exercise was invaluable, demonstrating my ability to:

1) Perform under pressure in a structured interview setting.

2) Articulate my qualifications coherently.

3) Control non-verbal communication, adhering to professional standards.

This reflective practice has significantly boosted my confidence and confirmed my preparedness for real-world job interviews.
